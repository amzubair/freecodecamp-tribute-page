            <p>Born around a thousand years ago in present day Iraq, Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (known in the West by the Latinised
                form of his first name, initially “Alhacen” and later “Alhazen”) was a pioneering scientific thinker who
                made important contributions to the understanding of vision, optics and light. His methodology of investigation,
                in particular using experiment to verify theory, shows certain similarities to what later became known as
                the modern scientific method.</p>
            <p>Through his Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manazir) and its Latin translation (De Aspectibus), his ideas influenced
                European scholars including those of the European Renaissance. Today, many consider him a pivotal figure
                in the history of optics and the “Father of modern Optics”.</p>
            <p>Ibn al-Haytham was born during a creative period known as the golden age of Muslim civilisation that saw many
                fascinating advances in science, technology and medicine. In an area that spread from Spain to China, inspirational
                men and women, of different faiths and cultures, built upon knowledge of ancient civilisations, making discoveries
                that had a huge and often under appreciated impact on our world.</p>
